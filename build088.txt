Variables Updated:

 
			- Updater has been added to current version 0.0.0.1 Build 0.0.87
			- Whilst I overview the toolkit and updater I review the current issues
      related to the toolkit. Thinking ahead to phase 3 - 0.0.0.3 this would
      be the start around this time to work on a new core for the toolkit as we
      take the brand into a new stage and build a brand new kit from the ground up.
      Moving away from the open source which also means removing Symenu and moving
      forward. I am excited for this opportunity.
			- 
			- Don't forget updater link error #Issue3
			- 
			- Just working on another part of the toolkit for distribution, once that gets cleared which should be in a few weeks I should hopefully be ready to give out the installer which also coincides with the updater.
